    <h5>LANE.</h5> Say--where's the boss?

<h5>MRS. BAUER.</h5> He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?

     [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._

<h5>LANE.</h5> Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
groceries for Sawyers.

<h5>MRS. BAUER.</h5> [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
which hangs beside the door._] Here.

<h5>LANE.</h5> What's the matter?

<h5>MRS. BAUER.</h5> [_Dully._] Huh?

<h5>LANE.</h5> [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.
